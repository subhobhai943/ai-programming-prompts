## üîç General Code Debugging

**Perfect for:** Runtime errors, unexpected behavior, crashes, exceptions

### üéØ The Prompt

```
You are an expert debugger and {language} developer. I'm experiencing {issue_type} with my code.

Problem Description:
- Expected behavior: {expected_behavior}
- Actual behavior: {actual_behavior}
- Error message (if any): {error_message}
- Environment: {environment_details}

Code to debug:
{code_snippet}

Context and constraints:
- {context_information}
- This code is part of: {project_context}
- Dependencies/libraries used: {dependencies}

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause of the issue
2. Explain why this problem occurs
3. Provide a corrected version of the code
4. Suggest preventive measures to avoid similar issues
5. Recommend debugging techniques for this type of problem
6. Highlight any potential related issues I should watch for

Additional analysis:
- Are there any performance implications?
- Security considerations?
- Best practices violations?
```

### üîß Variables to Replace

- `{language}` - Programming language
- `{issue_type}` - Type of issue (runtime error, logic error, performance issue)
- `{expected_behavior}` - What should happen
- `{actual_behavior}` - What actually happens
- `{error_message}` - Exact error message
- `{environment_details}` - OS, versions, etc.
- `{code_snippet}` - The problematic code
- `{context_information}` - Additional context
- `{project_context}` - What type of project this is
- `{dependencies}` - Libraries and frameworks used

### üí° Example Usage

**Input:**
```
You are an expert debugger and Python developer. I'm experiencing a runtime error with my code.

Problem Description:
- Expected behavior: Function should return the average of a list of numbers
- Actual behavior: Getting "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'"
- Error message (if any): TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
- Environment: Python 3.9, running in local development environment

Code to debug:
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

# Test data
data = [1, 2, "3", 4, 5]
result = calculate_average(data)
print(result)

Context and constraints:
- Data comes from user input via a web form
- This code is part of: A data analysis web application
- Dependencies/libraries used: Flask, NumPy
```

## ‚ö° Performance Issue Debugging

**Perfect for:** Slow code, memory issues, CPU bottlenecks, scalability problems

### üéØ The Prompt

```
Act as a performance optimization expert for {language}. I'm experiencing performance issues with my code.

Performance Problem:
- Current performance: {current_performance}
- Expected/target performance: {target_performance}
- Bottleneck symptoms: {symptoms}
- Testing methodology: {test_conditions}
- Hardware/environment: {system_specs}

Code with performance issues:
{code_snippet}

Additional context:
- Input data characteristics: {data_characteristics}
- Frequency of execution: {execution_frequency}
- Memory constraints: {memory_limits}
- Concurrency requirements: {concurrency_needs}

Please analyze and provide:
1. Performance bottleneck identification
2. Root cause analysis with measurements
3. Optimized code solution
4. Performance comparison (before/after estimates)
5. Alternative approaches to consider
6. Profiling recommendations
7. Monitoring suggestions for production
8. Scalability considerations

Focus areas:
- Time complexity analysis
- Memory usage optimization
- I/O efficiency
- Algorithm improvements
- Data structure optimization
```

### üîß Variables to Replace

- `{language}` - Programming language
- `{current_performance}` - Current speed/metrics
- `{target_performance}` - Desired performance
- `{symptoms}` - What you observe (slow, crashes, high CPU)
- `{test_conditions}` - How you're testing
- `{system_specs}` - Hardware and environment details
- `{code_snippet}` - The slow code
- `{data_characteristics}` - Size and type of data
- `{execution_frequency}` - How often code runs
- `{memory_limits}` - Available memory
- `{concurrency_needs}` - Multi-threading requirements

## üß† Logic Error Debugging

**Perfect for:** Incorrect results, wrong calculations, flawed business logic

### üéØ The Prompt

```
You are a logic analysis expert specializing in {language}. I have a logic error in my code that's producing incorrect results.

Logic Problem Analysis:
- Function/module purpose: {purpose}
- Expected logic flow: {expected_logic}
- Current incorrect behavior: {incorrect_behavior}
- Test cases that fail: {failing_tests}
- Test cases that pass: {passing_tests}

Code with logic error:
{code_snippet}

Business/domain context:
- Business rules: {business_rules}
- Edge cases to consider: {edge_cases}
- Input constraints: {input_constraints}
- Output requirements: {output_requirements}

Please provide:
