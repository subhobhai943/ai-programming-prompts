## 💡 Advanced Usage Tips

### 🎯 **Prompt Layering**
Combine multiple prompts for complex tasks:

1. Start with **Architecture** prompts for design
2. Use **Code Generation** for implementation  
3. Apply **Testing** prompts for validation
4. Finish with **Code Review** for quality

### 🔄 **Iterative Improvement**
Use prompts in sequence to refine results:

```
1st iteration: Basic implementation
2nd iteration: Add error handling  
3rd iteration: Optimize performance
4th iteration: Security hardening
```

### 🎨 **Context Enhancement**
Always provide rich context:

- **Project type**: Web app, CLI tool, library
- **Team size**: Solo, small team, enterprise
- **Timeline**: Proof of concept, MVP, production
- **Constraints**: Performance, security, budget

## 📋 Category Deep Dive

Perfect for creating new code from scratch.

**When to use:**
- Starting new features
- Prototyping ideas
- Learning new patterns
- Generating boilerplate

**Pro tip:** Be specific about requirements and constraints.

### 🐛 Debugging  
Systematic approach to problem-solving.

**When to use:**
- Error messages appear
- Unexpected behavior occurs
- Performance issues arise
- Logic errors detected

**Pro tip:** Include error messages, expected vs actual behavior.

### 👁️ Code Review
Comprehensive quality analysis.

**When to use:**
- Before production deployment
- During code reviews
- Security audits
- Architecture validation

**Pro tip:** Specify your quality standards and compliance requirements.

### 🏗️ Architecture
High-level system design guidance.

**When to use:**
- Starting new projects
- Scaling existing systems  
- Technology decisions
- Architecture reviews

**Pro tip:** Include scale requirements, team constraints, and technology preferences.

## 🛠️ Integration Methods

### Method 1: Direct Copy-Paste
**Best for:** Quick, one-off tasks

1. Browse categories in `prompt_library.json`
2. Find relevant prompt
3. Replace variables
4. Use in your AI tool

### Method 2: Script Integration
**Best for:** Repeated use, automation

```python
import json

# Load library
with open('prompt_library.json', 'r') as f:
    library = json.load(f)

# Get specific prompt
debug_prompt = library['prompts']['debugging']['general_debug']['prompt']

# Customize
customized = debug_prompt.format(
    language='Python',
    issue_type='runtime error',
    # ... other variables
)

# Use with AI API
response = ai_model.generate(customized)
```

### Method 3: Custom Tool Integration
**Best for:** Team workflows, CI/CD

Build custom tools using the structured JSON format:
- IDE extensions
- CLI tools  
- Web interfaces
- Slack bots

## 🎯 Prompt Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Start Simple, Add Detail**
```
Basic: "Debug this Python code"
Better: "Debug this Python function that should calculate averages"
Best: "Debug this Python function that calculates averages from CSV data but throws TypeError on mixed data types"
```

### 2. **Use Specific Examples** 
```
Vague: "Handle edge cases"
Specific: "Handle edge cases like empty arrays, null values, and extremely large numbers"
```

### 3. **Define Success Criteria**
```
Add: "The solution should be readable, performant, and follow PEP 8 standards"
```

### 4. **Request Explanations**
```
Add: "Explain your reasoning and any trade-offs made"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: Generic/Unhelpful Responses
**Solution:** Add more context and constraints
```
❌ "Write a function"
✅ "Write a Python function that validates email addresses, handles international domains, and returns detailed error messages for invalid formats"
```

### Problem: Code Doesn't Work
**Solution:** Include your environment details
```
Add: "Using Python 3.9, Flask 2.0, running on Ubuntu 20.04"
```

### Problem: Security Concerns Ignored  
**Solution:** Explicitly mention security requirements
```
Add: "Include input validation, SQL injection prevention, and follow OWASP guidelines"
```

### Problem: Performance Issues
**Solution:** Specify performance requirements
```
Add: "Optimize for handling 10,000+ records with <100ms response time"
```

## 🌟 Best Practices

### ✅ **Do's**
- Always customize prompts for your specific use case
- Provide concrete examples and constraints  
- Specify your experience level and context
- Ask for explanations along with code
- Include error handling and security requirements
- Test suggestions before implementing
- Iterate and refine prompts based on results

### ❌ **Don'ts**
- Use prompts verbatim without customization
- Omit critical context and requirements
- Ignore security and performance considerations  
- Accept code without understanding it
- Skip testing and validation
- Forget to specify coding standards
- Rush to implementation without review
